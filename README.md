# LMSC-261_FinalProject
Preproposal
What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to make a choose your adventure rpj in python. Using class and deffining functions Ill be able to add health, strength and coins to purchase upgrades. 

Do you have any questions of your own?
I already started coding a bit of this. When you purchase an upgrade the strenth of the charactor should go up. How can I change that number.
